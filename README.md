Credit card fraud detection has become an important problem in the financial industry around the world, particularly in an emerging market like Kenya, where the rates at which digital payment systems (e.g., M-PESA) and card-based transactions are increasing and staggering. Traditional methods for fraud detection such as rule-based systems, can no longer keep up with the rise of more advanced types of fraud. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid fraud detection (HFD) system combining different ML models, including TensorFlow, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Artificial intelligence (AI) -based interpretation through GPT-4o-mini to formulate better prediction accuracy and minimize false positives while improving interpretability.
The system architecture is designed as a four-layer system, including a Data Input Layer, a Processing Layer, an AI Integration Layer, and an Output Layer. An infiltration (Data Input Layer) of data ingestion, cleaning, and normalization of data, such as missing values and class imbalance through synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE). In the Processing Layer, TensorFlow is used for deep pattern recognition, XGBoost is used for gradient boosting analysis, and Random Forest is used for ensemble learning. For this purpose, model predictions are combined using a weighted averaging ensemble technique to optimize detection performance. The AI Integration Layer harnesses GPT-4o-mini to analyze observations for any advanced patterns and to produce intelligible human responses to detected anomalies, overcoming the black-box issue that afflicts most machine learning systems. The Output Layer presents interactive data visualizations through a Flask-based web dashboard, enabling users to analyze transaction trends, the likelihood of fraud, and model performance metrics.
The system accepts CSV files of up to 100MB per batch, with approximately 1,000 transactions, supporting a trade period of less than 10 minutes. The hybrid model also obtained an overall detection accuracy rate of 99.2% on metrics such as precision, recall, F-1 score, and ROC AUC, achieving a 30% reduction in false positives relative to existing single-model methods. Preliminary evaluations demonstrate a user satisfaction of 85% when relying on these AI-driven explanations, greatly improving understanding. By providing a solution that is scalable, interpretable, and offers high accuracy tailored for the specific characteristics of Kenya's digital financial ecosystem, this research contributes to the field of financial fraud detection. In addition to enhancing fraud detection efforts, the solution also improves operational efficiency and compliance with regulations through an explainable decision-making process.
